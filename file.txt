1 - Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.
2 - Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.
3 - It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us.
4 - We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God.
5 - Your playing small does not serve the world.
6 - There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you.
7 - We are all meant to shine, as children do.
8 - We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us.
9 - It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone.
10 - And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same.
11 - As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.
